## Contributing to paperclip-multiple

If you read the README, you know we aren't using this library anymore. We'll probably take a look,
but beware that feature requests or bug reports without any code attached might not get a big response.

That said, if you still want to contribute:

* Thoroughly what the problem is, or the feature does.
* Include as much information as possible, like gem versions and your `has_attached_file` definitions.
* Follow conventions in the code and add tests.

If you want to take over the project and continue maintaining it, feel free to contact 
[@mrsimo](https://github.com/mrsimo) or just open an issue.
